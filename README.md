# Music_streaming
this is our project two for the KU coding bootcamp 

# <TwinkleToesMusicStreamer>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
Motivation for the project came from music streaming apps like sound cloud, apple music, and spotify.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
We built this project because we all enjoy music and we wanted to create a website that could link your music or profiles from spotify and other music streaming services.
- What problem does it solve?
It was meant to create a more ease of access having all your music from separate platforms their for you to find and listen to.
- What did you learn?
We learned that we bit off a bit more than we can chew, but we also learned how the different routes worked for handlebars as well as getting responses from the api. All in all we learned that if we had more time we could achieve what our end goal was but this time it was a bit to much of a stretch.
